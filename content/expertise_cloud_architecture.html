<p class="text-gray-700 text-left">At Amazon Web Services (AWS), I had the privilege of serving as a key technical point of contact for the US Government concerning a significant classified cloud offering known as C2S.<a href="http://www.govexec.com/magazine/features/2014/07/daring-deal/88207/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Learn more about C2S (opens in new tab)" class="inline-block bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white p-1 rounded text-xs transition duration-300 ml-1 align-middle"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> It was a challenging yet fulfilling role where I could contribute to the proposal that ultimately won the engagement, and also assist with the customer's accreditation process.<br><br>
    
Later, at Google Cloud, I was given the chance to build and lead the global customer support and operations teams. This involved setting up 24x7 support structures, developing Technical Account Management, and guiding Strategic Customer Engineering efforts. I also had the honor of founding and leading the customer-facing side of Google's renowned Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) organization.
<br><br>
Through these roles, I've gained a deep appreciation for the complexities of distributed systems design and the continuous effort required to ensure the reliability of large-scale cloud services. It's always been about working with talented teams to help customers succeed in the cloud.</p>
