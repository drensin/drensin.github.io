<p class="text-gray-700 text-left">I've had the good fortune to be a multi-time founder, experiencing the incredible journey of building companies from the ground up, and thankfully, seeing them through to successful exits, including both acquisitions and an IPO.</p>
<br>
<p>As a co-founder and CTO of Riverbed Technologies, we worked on creating enterprise middleware that aimed to bridge corporate systems with the then-emerging world of mobile devices; this technology eventually became the basis for the Palm HotSync Server, and the company was later acquired.</p>
<br>
<p>At Omnisky Corp., where I served as CTO, CPO, and Chief Strategist, we were at the forefront of pioneering the first commercial wireless internet service for palm-sized devices â€“ an exciting venture that led to an IPO on NASDAQ and was subsequently acquired.</p>
<br>
<p>Later, as the Founding CEO and Chief Scientist of Reality Mobile LLC, our team focused on developing enterprise-grade mobile video streaming software, specifically designed to perform in challenging, low-bandwidth environments, which also led to an acquisition. Each of these experiences was a unique learning opportunity, filled with challenges and triumphs, and I'm grateful for the teams I worked with and the problems we aimed to solve.</p>
