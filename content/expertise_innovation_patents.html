<p class="text-gray-700 text-left">I'm grateful to have been granted several US patents over the years which span a range of technology domains, including mobile computing, wireless communication, network optimization, data security and access control, and cloud technologies. Each one represents a journey of problem-solving and a collaborative effort with many talented individuals. It's been a privilege to contribute in this way, and I believe that the process of invention, with its blend of creativity and rigor, is a deeply rewarding endeavor.
