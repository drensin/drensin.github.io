<p class="text-gray-700 text-left">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a field I'm particularly passionate about, and I was incredibly fortunate to contribute to its evolution at Google. A significant part of my work involved founding and leading Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE), which was essentially the customer-facing arm of Google's SRE. The goal was to partner closely with Google Cloud's largest customers, sharing SRE principles and practices to help them build and operate highly reliable services on our platform.<br><br>My responsibilities also grew to include leading the team responsible for forecasting and planning the capacity of Google's vast global network, ensuring it could seamlessly support all of Google's products and services. Beyond these direct leadership roles, I also had the opportunity to serve as a strategic advisor to the broader Google SRE organization as well as a core contributor and editor for the <i>Site Reliability Workbook</i>.<br><br>It's been a humbling experience to work alongside so many brilliant engineers dedicated to the art and science of keeping large-scale systems running smoothly and reliably for users worldwide.</p>
