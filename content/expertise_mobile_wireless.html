<p class="text-gray-700 text-left">I've been fascinated by mobile and wireless technology since its early days and was fortunate to be involved in several ventures that explored its potential.</p> 
<br>
<p>As a co-founder of Riverbed Technologies, we focused on creating enterprise middleware designed to connect corporate systems to mobile devices â€“ a challenge that led to technology forming the basis of the Palm HotSync Server. It was an exciting time trying to bridge these two worlds.</p> 
<br>
<p>Later, at Omnisky Corp., I had the opportunity to help pioneer what became the first commercial wireless internet service for palm-sized devices, which really felt like we were pushing the boundaries of what was possible at the time.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, at Reality Mobile LLC, where I was the Founding CEO and Chief Scientist, our team tackled the challenge of developing enterprise-grade mobile video streaming software. We specifically aimed to make it work effectively even in very challenging, low-bandwidth environments, which required a deep dive into understanding mobile constraints and optimizing for them. These experiences were incredibly formative, teaching me a lot about the nuances of mobile and wireless systems.</p>
